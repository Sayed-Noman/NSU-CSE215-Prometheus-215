## Introduction:
Prometheus-215 is an idea to bring together all drivers under one digital platform and control them by one higher authority. Prometheus-215 will be developed by Java. Where it’s user will be allowed to make a request to join this platform and accepted members by the admin can see their current status on the database. Users will be given a certain points and the points will decrease based around their actions and Admin will have the higher power to judge them whether users are eligible to drive or not.

## Project Objectives:
The main objective of the development of the project Prometheus-215 is to build an application by using an Object Oriented Analysis and Design Methodology that will enable the programmer to learn the right way of conducting analysis and development of software. The followings are the rest of the objectives for the development of the software.


## Objectives of the project:
•	The program will be able to read inputs from user and   combining them as a package user will be able to make a request to the admin.
•	The program will have multi user login System (user, admin).
•	The program will have a user interface where user will be able to see his information and current status and also will be able to print them.
•	The program will have a admin interface where admin can :

      1.	Accept the request of the applicant.
      2.	Update & Show the status of the driver.
      3.	File issues against driver.
      4.	Show the eligible drivers rank.

•	The program will have a about page where user or admin can see the code of conduct.
•	The program will have exit option.

## Hardware:

The hardware needed does not have to be state of the art in technology. The Project is in Eclipse IDE and does not require special graphic cards that are required to run high Applications.
Here is a list of basic Hardware needed to run the program:

    •	Intel Pentium Processor or any other compatible Processor, 750 MHz or greater.

    •	Minimum 128 MB of RAM capacity or more.

    •	Minimum of 16 MB Graphic Card RAM capacities or more.

    •	Recommended hard disk space of 1 GB or more.


## Software:

Java programming language is being used to develop the project. Program coding will be done with the help of  Eclipse/Netbeans IDE to develop the program coding. 
Here is a list of basic Software needed to run the program:
  •	Windows 98, 2000,8,10 or XP or Linux operating system.

  •	Java 2SDK, Standard Edition version 1.4.1 or above.

  •	Eclipse/Netbeans IDE editing program.

## Conclusion:
By developing a project using Java, the project can be run on many platforms. We may need to add or change some of functionalities of the project based around our requirements.
